# 🚢 Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on various features like age, gender, ticket class, etc. Using machine learning, we preprocess the data, train a predictive model, and deploy it for real-time predictions.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)  
- **Machine Learning** (Decision Tree Classifier)  
- **Data Preprocessing** (Simple Imputer, One-Hot Encoding)  
- **Model Deployment** (Pickle for model serialization)  
- **Pipeline & Column Transformer** (For efficient workflow)  

## 📊 Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**  
- Handled missing values using **Simple Imputer**.  
- Encoded categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**.  

### 2️⃣ **Model Training & Evaluation**  
- Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier**.  
- Evaluated model performance using **accuracy score**.  

### 3️⃣ **Model Deployment**  
- Exported the trained model using **Pickle**.  
- Preprocessed user input to ensure compatibility before making predictions.  

### 4️⃣ **Optimizing Workflow**  
- Used **Pipeline** and **Column Transformer** to streamline preprocessing and training.  

## 🎯 Outcome  
Successfully built a predictive model that estimates passenger survival on the Titanic, optimizing the workflow for better efficiency.
